A culture of research, experimentation and usability are the matrixes that have always defined Stone Island; the brand, established in 1982, destined to become a symbol of extreme research on fibres and textiles applied to innovative design.Each Stone Island piece is born from the perfect synthesis between experimentation and usability, between the study of fabrics and rationality. The study of uniforms and of workwear, its evolution according to new functions of use, becomes Stone Island’s observatory for defining a project where the clothing’s purpose is never just purely aesthetic.

Parisian fashion brand Coperni used Fabrican's sprayable, liquid fibre to spray a dress onto a model at its Spring Summer 2023 show at Paris Fashion Week. Fabrican's spray-on fabric is a liquid made up of natural and synthetic fibres, such as wool and mohair, cotton, nylon and cellulose depending on the desired feel, that is suspended in a polymer solution. The liquid solution is sprayed by an aerosol or spray gun onto the body, which then evaporates as it makes contact with a surface to form a non-woven fabric. After the shape of a dress was sprayed onto the body of Hadid, a Coperni employee began to cut and alter the white dress, shortening its length, adding a slit and draping the straps off Hadid's shoulders before she then walked around the room.
