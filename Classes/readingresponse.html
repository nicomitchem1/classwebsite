“The never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky.”

This quote provides an interesting sense of imagery, when reading this 
I feel as if I am in the same exact 
spot as the character. Imagery is something that I enjoy when 
reading as the ability of language
is so strong that it can develop images in one’s mind.

“A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. A server is a computer that’s always connected to the internet so that when someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website.”

I choose this quote because it breaks down the definition of a website into terms that an average person
can comprehend. Understanding the core principles of this allows one to 
tackle website projects with less overwhelming feelings. Classifying what a website is can also help translate from peer to peer.
