Oakley, known for its athletic eyewear since the mid ’80s, first debuted the OVERTHETOP “Precious Mettle” in the 2000 Summer Olympics and was worn by Trinidad & Tobago’s Ato Bolden in the Men’s 100-meter dash where he won silver. From there, the shades have been part of a number of historical style moments. Bolton remembers Oakley as a “a fun company to be associated with because they were always trying to push the envelope, get stares, and get people to think differently about what eyewear could look like.” The sunglass company has been seen on iconic figures like Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman and actor Brad Pitt.
